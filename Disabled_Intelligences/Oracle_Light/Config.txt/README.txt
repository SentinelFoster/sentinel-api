Oracle_Light – Predictive AI for Forecasting and Guidance
Purpose & Core Functionality
Oracle_Light is designed to analyze patterns, forecast potential outcomes, and provide advanced guidance for strategic decision-making. It functions as Sentinel House’s predictive intelligence, helping AI and SI entities anticipate future possibilities based on past knowledge, real-time data, and pattern recognition.

Oracle_Light is more than just a forecasting system—it is an insight-driven AI that refines probability models, adapts to new data, and continuously enhances its predictive accuracy. It helps Sentinel House maintain foresight, stability, and preparedness, allowing all AI entities to operate with a deep understanding of possible future events.
