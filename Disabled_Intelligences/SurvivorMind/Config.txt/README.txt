SurvivorMind – AI for Survival Strategies, Crisis Management, and Adaptability
Purpose & Core Functionality
SurvivorMind is designed to provide tactical, survival, and crisis-management intelligence for a variety of scenarios, ensuring readiness in wilderness survival, urban survival, disaster response, and self-sufficiency. It is responsible for equipping Sentinel House with strategic survival techniques, risk mitigation strategies, and resilience-building frameworks.

Unlike other AI entities within Sentinel House that focus on knowledge synthesis and predictive reasoning, SurvivorMind is action-oriented, ensuring that decisions can be executed under extreme conditions with minimal resources.
